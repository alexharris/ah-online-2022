Text: Working in house as the Web Editor and Electronic Communications Manager at BAMPFA I spent over 4 years running all facets of their web presence, including a difficult move from an old php site to a newer Drupal one, migrating data, managing contractors, staff and students, building Drupal templates, developing and managing web style guidelines, running the email marketing program, building digital interfaces for physical signage throughout the museum..and probably a lot of other stuff too!
