Title: Ringo Studio

----

Text: With a beautiful design by the fine folks at Meehan Spinat, the Ringo Studio site provided a number of interesting Javascript and CSS challenges with an end result of a site that really highlights the rich and immersive interior design work of principal Madelynn Ringo and breaks out of the box of standard site design and functionality. A custom Wordpress “project” content type makes the site content easy to manage and update.
